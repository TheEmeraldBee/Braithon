# Braithon
The brainfuck clone no one though they needed

## WARNING: This is a joke
There will be no guaranteed support for this I simply made this to remind myself how python works for college.

# My personal goals for this project
- [ ] Add tons of built in modules.
- [ ] Ensure that no bugs really exist, and that it is fully usable.
- [x] Be proud of what a crappy project this is

# Planned Modules
- [ ] Error Handling Module
- [ ] Named Variables Module (Kinda breaks the main program idea)
